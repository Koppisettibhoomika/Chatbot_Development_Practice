# Chatbot_Development_Practice
Overview

This chatbot is designed to interact with users by responding to their queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find the most relevant responses from a given text file (chatbot.txt). The chatbot can recognize greetings and generate responses based on user input.

Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed before running the chatbot:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Required libraries:

numpy

nltk

scikit-learn

string

If you are using Google Colab, these libraries come pre-installed. Otherwise, install them using:

pip install numpy nltk scikit-learn

How to Run the Chatbot

Option 1: Running in Google Colab

Open Google Colab.

Create a new notebook.

Upload the chatbot.txt file to Colab.

Copy and paste the chatbot code into a code cell.

Run the code cell step by step.

Start chatting with the bot!

Option 2: Running in Jupyter Notebook

Open Jupyter Notebook (install if not available: pip install notebook).

Create a new Python notebook.

Ensure chatbot.txt is in the same directory as your notebook.

Copy and paste the chatbot code into a code cell.

Run the notebook and interact with the chatbot.

Features

Text Preprocessing: Converts text to lowercase, removes punctuation, and applies lemmatization.

Tokenization: Splits text into sentences and words using nltk.sent_tokenize() and nltk.word_tokenize().

Greeting Recognition: Responds appropriately when greeted.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms user input into numerical vectors.

Cosine Similarity Matching: Finds the most relevant response based on similarity.

Interactive Chatbot: Keeps conversing until the user types 'Bye'.

Example Interaction

Julie: My name is Julie. I will answer your queries about Chatbots. If you want to exit, type Bye!
User: Hi
Julie: Hey!
User: What is a chatbot?
Julie: A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation.
User: Bye
Julie: Bye! Take care.

Troubleshooting

If you get an NLTK download error, run:

import nltk
nltk.download('popular')

If the chatbot does not respond properly, ensure that chatbot.txt is correctly loaded and contains relevant content.

Future Enhancements

Add Named Entity Recognition (NER) to improve understanding.

Integrate Deep Learning models for better response generation.

Deploy as a web-based chatbot using Flask or FastAPI.

Developed for educational purposes using NLP techniques. ðŸš€
